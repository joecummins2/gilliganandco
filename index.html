        <div>Most people wrongly assume that all their possessions automatically pass to their husband or wife or other members of the family. For unmarried couples the situation is even worse than that for married couples.<br><br>Making a Will is the only way to ensure that your wishes are carried out after your death. If you have not made a valid Will your property will pass according to the Laws of Intestacy. This may not be what you would have wished. In any event it is likely to take longer to finalise than if you had made a Will. During this time your beneficiaries may not be able to draw any money from the estate. It can mean arguments and distress for relatives. Making a Will lets your loved ones know that you cared enough.</div>

If you do not have a Lasting Power of Attorney in place at the time of becoming incapable then somebody will have to apply to the Court of Protection for a deputyship order, sometimes the local authority would apply for this to manage your affairs. This is a very expensive and lengthy procedure which can easily be avoided.
